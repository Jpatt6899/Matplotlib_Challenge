# Matplotlib_Challenge

Hello! 

This code contains the breakdown of informaiton take from mice during a lab expierment. This code performs the following:

- Cleaned dataframe excluding duplicates. 
- A summary statistics table. 
- Your tasks are to do the following:
- A bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen throughout                 the course of the study.
- A pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.
- A box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
- A line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for specific mouse.
- A scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
-The correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plotted with linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
